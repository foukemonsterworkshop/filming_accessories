# DIY Filming Accessories

### The Boom
I became frustrated with the limitations of tripods in my small shop space and after a few sources of inspiration started working on a balanced arm boom.
The boom is mounted to a single point, but the mount can be reused or dovetailed into a duplicated mounting point.

### The Dolly
Real dollys are expensive, and the ones that are "smart" are much _more_ expensive.
This one is made almost entirely of 3d printed parts, extremely cheap components, and wood.

I used a knockoff arduino mega, a knockoff ILI9341 touchscreen, and some small and inexpensive stepper motors.

The necessary arduino files are {here}
And the models can be found {here}
